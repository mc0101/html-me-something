            <h3>Emmy</h3>
            <p>Emmy was the first cat of House Charrollope. She belonged to Jack Hope and was his cat for 18 years prior to the formation of the House. She was a feisty cat with a ferocious appetite. Several times the people thought she was on the brink of death, only to come back to full strength in a couple days.</p>
            <p>Emmy was also known as Kiffers, Kitters, Squishers (she was also referred to as a "squishy kitty"), and Emmers.</p>

            <h3>Junebug</h3>
            <p>Junebug, also known as June (named after June Carter Cash) became associated with the two founding members of the House in the months prior to the House's establishment. She came to the members from a friend of theirs, Adri Pendergrass, who could not take June with her to Chicago.</p>
            <p>June is also known as Juner, June June, Juner Booner, and Boomper.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In March 2012, the House of Charrollope was established. June and Emmy served as the cats of the House from March 2012 until November 2013, when Emmy,<br>
            at the age of nineteen, passed away.</p>

            <h3>Seamus</h3>
            <p>In January 2014, after a sufficient period of mourning for Emmy, the House Charrollope adopted a new cat from the <a href="http://www.lawrencehumane.org">Lawrence, Kansas Humane Society</a>. He was feisty of spirit, so they named him Seamus after Seamus Finnegan from the Harry Potter series.</p>
            <p>Seamus is also known as Shamers, Shit Bird, Butternut, and Butters.</p>

            <h3>Louise</h3>
            <p>After the Charrollopes established a property under their own names, they adopted Louise in August 2016 from <a href="http://www.waysidewaifs.org">Wayside Waifs</a>. Louise is small but ferocious, as she has proven herself to be the best hunter among the cats of the House. This ferocity is why she is named after Louise Belcher from <em>Bob's Burgers</em>. She is also known as Weezy and Weezers.</p>
