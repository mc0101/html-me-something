            <h3>Emmy</h3>
            <p>Emmy was the first cat of House Charrollope. She belonged to Jack Hope and was his cat for 18 years prior to the formation of the House.</p>
            <p>Emmy was a feisty cat with a ferocious appetite. Several times the people thought she was on the brink of death, only to come back to full strength in a couple days.</p>
            <p>Emmy was also known as Kiffers, Kitters, Squishers (she was also referred to as a "squishy kitty"), and Emmers.</p>

            <h3>Junebug</h3>
            <p>Junebug, also known as June (named after June Carter Cash) became associated with the two founding members of the House in the months prior to the House's establishment.</p>
            <p>She came to the members from a friend of theirs, Adri Pendergrass, who could not take June with her to Chicago.</p>
            <p>June is also known as Juner, June June, Juner Booner, and Boomper.</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>In March 2012, the House of Charrollope was established. June and Emmy served as the cats of the House from March 2012 until November 2013, when Emmy,<br>
            at the age of nineteen, passed away.

            <img src="C:\users\Megan\lc101\html-me-something\images\Seamus.jpg">   
            <h3>Seamus</h3>
            <p>In January 2014, after a sufficient period of mourning for Emmy, the House Charrollope adopted a new cat from the <a href="www.lawrencehumane.org">Lawrence, Kansas Humane Society</a>.</p>
            <p>He was feisty of spirit, so they named him Seamus after Seamus Finnegan from the Harry Potter series.</p>
            <p>Seamus is also known as Shamers, Shit Bird, Butternut, and Butters.</p>
            <br> 
            <img src="C:\users\Megan\lc101\html-me-something\images\Louise.jpg">   
            <h3>Louise</h3>
            <p>After the Charrollopes established a property under their own names, they acquired Louise in August 2016 from <a href="www.waysidewaifs.org">Wayside Waifs</a>.</p>
            <p>Louise is small but ferocious, as she has proven herself to be the best hunter among the cats of the House. She is also known as Weezy and Weezers.</p>
